A summary of the project goals
The main goal for this project was to get it coded the best I could and save as many steps as I could so that I could potenially see where the break was.  
Instructions the player may need
Up and down arrows to move the space ship and then space bar to fire the bullets
A list of technologies and techniques you used
movement for the asteroids
incorperating the bullets which was a new element for me to use
Attempting to add a pause screen

A description of your process   - I started with the sprites.  I knew that this was going to take the longest and cause the most headaches for me.  I was able to get those done with a small hicup in the collision.  
Last things that I added were the into screen and the pause screen.  I'm pretty sure that is what broke the code and I'm not sure where the break is.
What did you learn?
I learned that breaking it down step by step help.  Coding out each sprite and making sure that they work helps in writing the overall code.  It also gave me small victories as I went.
Where did you get stuck?
There were a couple spots.  Collision with the bullets and the asteroids.  I also got stuck on the pause and intor screens not coming up.  I'm pretty sure that adding these elements broke the code as a whole/
What would you like to improve?
Coding out the GUI individually.  I think that if I had done that then I might have potentially found some of these breaks
How would you do things differently next time?
I think that doing the GUI the way that I did the sprites is something that I would do differently and then putting it all together once I know each GUI element works like I need it to
How far did you stray from the game design document?
I think the only thing I didn't get in was the collision sounds.  It was something that got away from me when I was trying to figure out the collisions
How did you stay on track?
I just took one step at a time.  I started with one sprite and then moved forward from there.  I made sure to save eact sprite in github as I went so that I knew there was a working code there incase something broke later.
